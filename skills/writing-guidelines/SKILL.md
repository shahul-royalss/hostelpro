# Writing Guidelines

Review files for compliance with Writing Guidelines.

## How It Works

1. Read the bundled guidelines in [guidelines-snapshot.md](guidelines-snapshot.md)
2. Read the specified files (or prompt user for files/pattern)
3. Check against all rules in the guidelines
4. Output findings in the terse `file:line` format

## Guidelines Source

The rules live in `guidelines-snapshot.md` in this skill's directory — a vendored snapshot of https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vercel-labs/writing-guidelines/main/command.md (pinned at install time, 2026-08-01, so review behavior is deterministic and works offline). Only refresh the snapshot if the user explicitly asks to update the guidelines.

## Usage

When a user provides a file or pattern argument:
1. Read `guidelines-snapshot.md` from this skill's directory
2. Read the specified files
3. Apply all rules from the guidelines
4. Output findings using the format specified in the guidelines

If no files specified, ask the user which files to review.
